RescueCD Area31 Tools Help
____________________

First, a little help. Everytime you find a text like this 
while navigating you can move with below commands:

PgDn/SPACE	- Move one page below
PgUg/'b'	- Move one page above
ENTER/DOWN/'j'	- Move one line below
UP/'k'		- Move one line above
LEFT/'h'	- Move left (scroll)
RIGHT/'l'	- Move roght (Scroll)
HOME/'g'	- Move to the beginning of file
END/'G'	- Move to the end of file
'/'		- Search forward (below)
'?'		- Search below (above)
'N'		- Repeat last search (below)
'n'		- Repeat last search (above)


Beyond that, you must know that you are executing a real multitasking
operating system so you are not confined into current program. You can
access other consoles and take a look anytime without disturbing chroot
process. To do it you will need to learn the commands that control Linux
console. You will use those commands all the time while logged into 
RescueCD Area31 console.





# "Virtual" consoles and scrollback

Now, the screen you're looking into is probably VIRTUAL CONSOLE
NUMBER ONE, (or '/dev/tty1' on Linux-speech, so to speak). Normally there are
a number of available virtual consoles. When you enter the system,
there will be six consoles. To alternate between them use Alt-F1, Alt-F2, Alt-F3
for autologin use Alt-F4, Alt-F5 and Alt-F6 to login with a specific user.
While using one console your temrinal will scroll a small amount of lines. To
scrollback the console hold Right-Shift key while pressing PageUp. To scroll
the console forward press PageDown while holding Right-Shift. This can be specially
usefull to read initialize messages that can pass to fast on the screen, helping reading
in another way.


The first three consoles are auto-login shells.
Use from the fourfth console on to login with a specific user case you wish
to create them.





# KEYMAP - Altering keyboard map:

KEYMAP: This option allows you to remap your keyboard to one of the many international maps
bundled with Linux. If you are using a br-abnt2 keyboard you can skip this option.




# Partitioning your disk

To customize your RescueCD it will be needed to separate a Linux partition
to be mounted at '/mnt/custom' for the scripts copy all files needed for a perfect
customization. A chroot environment will be available as also for hot changes to
be done like compiling or removing softwares utilizing Portage or any other way desired.

You will need at least one type of Linux partition and optionally a swap partition.
In my opinion, (if you have a reasonable amount disk space create a partition
with at least 50 GB for kernel recompilations be executed without problems.
As an example of the minimum required:

    [ 30 GB or more for /mnt/custom partition ]
    [ 2 GB or more for swap partition type ]


Some people like a separate partition to store generated ISO files but I think that's
bullshit, all you need is to maintain a Linux partition with good amount of disk space
and a good filesystem like EXT4 or reiserfs.


The amount of hard disk space you will need to dedicate to Linux depends on which
type of software you pretend to compile and how much space you have available.
My Linux partition in '/mnt/custom' has something like 90 GB. If you have spare disk space
it will be easier to compile and test eventual bugs noting that logs consume a large
amount of disk space. Big software projects also require a large amount of disk
space to compile like libreOffice demands 8 GB or firefox that require 6 GB of cache.
It's also useful to have a partition with a large amount of disk space to work with
big files like the ones used in eletronic editting or diverse graphical applications
such as audio and video.

Area31 RescueCD system has builtin vim editor, diverse network tools like nmap,
tcpdump, iptraf, etc, and will consume ~20 MB RAM in console and ~90 MB RAM in
graphical interface.

Partitioning is made with partitioning tools like fdisk. There are two Linux fdisk
version in text mode. 'fdisk' is default and there is 'cfdisk' that is a friendly
version in command line. Most people probably will say 'cfdisk' or 'gparted' unless
he's a dinossaur like me preferring good old 'fdisk'. Anyway, anyone will do the work.

Certify yourself to use partition type "83 (Linux)" or type "82 (Linux swap)" so that
RescueCD Area31 Tools can recognize and mount them in '/mnt/custom' and swap. In 'fdisk'
type 't' for it and 'w' to write changes.

If you prefer an easy to use graphical partitiong tool, you can use 'gparted' creating all
your partitions using graphical interface (startx).




# SWAP

If your machine doesn't have a lot of RAM available you should know how to activate
a swap partition to extend it even if your system doesn't work in an optimal speed.

Normally you won't need to format a partition or activate swap to utilize RescueCD Area31
Tools via liveCD to do trivial work or data recovery but if you want to compile softwares or
customize the image, having an active swap is an interesting idea primarly on virtualized
environments.

After creating a swap partition using a partitioning tool, you'll need to use 'mkswap'
to format it then activate it with 'swapon'.
Verifying the partition table using 'fdisk -l' we can see these lines:

   Device Boot	Start	End	Blocks	Size	Id	Type
   /dev/sda2		2048	8388607	8386560	4G	82	Linux swap / Solaris


Then the format command would be:

  # mkswap /dev/sda2
  # sync

And to activate it:

  # swapon /dev/sda2


If you wish, use ADDSWAP option in the main menu to format and mount in a pratical way.



# RescueCD Customization

If you wish to customize the RescueCD you need to access the main menu
and format a Linux partition following previous hints. I tend to follow
the following order to customize the RescueCD:

ADD-SWAP (to configure my swap partition)
ADD-TARGET (to configure my Linux partitions)
CHROOT (to configure or mount chroot environment)
GEN-ISO (to generate a custom ISO image)

I hope that those options would be used in an intuitive manner. Just by reading
carefully the options presented on the screen and remembering that both use and
customization require advanced knowledge of Linux systems structure. If you doesn't
know what a filesystem is or how does a kernel works or how does a liveCD environment
works, run to the hills.



FINALIZE: This ends RescueCD Area31 Tools.

Have fun using or customizing RescueCD Area31!
